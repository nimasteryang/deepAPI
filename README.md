# Deep API Learning
Replication of Gu's article Deep API Learning

# train
use the train.ipynb


# transformer implementation structure 
1. transformer.py define the layers
2. bleu_transformer.py are used for bleu store evaluation
3. train_transformer.py are used to train the model

# link to the complete program contain dataset and output files (too large to put on github)
